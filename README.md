A simple and interactive React application designed to collect and display customer feedback statistics for a cafe.

### 📝 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to master the core principles of React: component architecture, state management with hooks, and conditional rendering. It provides a clean UI for tracking positive, neutral, and negative reviews in real-time.

### 🔑 Key Features & My Work:
- **Stateful Logic:** Used the `useState` hook to track feedback categories and update statistics instantly.
- **Component Decomposition:** Structured the app into reusable components: `Description`, `Options`, `Feedback`, and `Notification`.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Implemented logic to show feedback statistics only after the first review is received, otherwise displaying a notification.
- **Dynamic Calculations:** Developed helper functions to calculate the total number of reviews and the percentage of positive feedback.
- **Persistent Data:** (If implemented) Leveraged `localStorage` to save feedback data across page reloads.

### 🚀 Learning Outcomes
* Understanding **Lifting State Up** to share data between components.
* Working with **Synthetic Events** in React (handling button clicks).
* Mastering **PropTypes** (or basic type checking) to ensure data integrity.
